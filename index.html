   <h1 class="intro">Website Explanation</h1>
      <p id="welcome">Hi! Thanks for checking out this random page about Magic: The Gathering. I know there are a ton of Magic websites out there already like <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com" target="blank">Star City Games</a>, <a href="http://www.channelfireball.com" target="blank">Channel Fireball</a>, <a href="http://magic.tcgplayer.com" target="blank">TCG Player</a>, and <a href="http://www.galactictreasures.com" target="blank">Galactic Treasures</a>. Thus, I really appreciate you taking the time to get this far on the page.</p>
      <p id="purpose">My goal isn't to provide more of something that's already out there like TCG Player's card/price search bar (you can disregard this; it's for school). Rather, I'd like to use this page as more of an experiment to bring new ideas and tools to the Magic community. Since this website is actually tied into the work that I'm doing for coding school right now, I imagine things will be constantly changing on this site.</p>

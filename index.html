<h1>Website Explanation</h1>
<p>Hi! Thanks for checking out this random page about Magic: The Gathering. I know there are a ton of Magic websites out there already like <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com" target="blank">Star City Games</a>, <a href="http://www.channelfireball.com" target="blank">Channel Fireball</a>, <a href="http://magic.tcgplayer.com" target="blank">TCG Player, and <a href="http://www.galactictreasures.com" target="blank">Galactic Treasures</a>. Thus, I really appreciate you taking the time to get this far on the page.</p>
<p>My goal isn't to provide more of something that's already out there. Rather, I'd like to use this page as more of an experiment to bring new ideas and tools to the Magic community. Since this website is actually tied into the work that I'm doing for coding school right now, I imagine things will be constantly changing on this site.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas I've had to help improve the Magic community.</p>
<h3>Ideas</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Top 8 Tournament Calculator Using OCR</li>
	<li>Collection Protection</li>
</ul>
<p>More importantly, I'd like to use this website as a sounding board to understand what the community would like to see be developed.

Please fill out the form below to submit your ideas and suggestions. Thanks.</p>
